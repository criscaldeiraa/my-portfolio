    aboutme: "I am a 22-year-old who spends my days coding, going to the gym and playing futsal, and reading. Although I consider myself to be a boring and normal person, I discovered that knowing how to program gives me the power to make anything possible and solve any problem - it's mind-blowing! In 2022, I began teaching myself coding, and now I am a Computer Science student at Universidade Aberta in Portugal. My ultimate goal is to become a Software Engineer, capable of tackling any bug that comes my way :)",
